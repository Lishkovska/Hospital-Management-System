            Milk free diet
            Why are milk-free diets used? Some people cannot tolerate milk.
            This may be due to an allergy or intolerance to milk protein or from an inability
            to digest the sugar (lactose) found in milk. All milk and milk products should be excluded unless it is known that the person can tolerate small quantities or highly cooked milk. If lactose (milk sugar) is causing the problem most people will be able to tolerate some lactose without getting symptoms .
            If doing a milk-free diet trial,it is best to follow the diet strictly to begin with and to  get a clear answer. The milk should be reintroduced to check any improvement was due to the diet. It is  possible to find a level of milk which is tolerated.

            Low Potassium diet This information should only be used for patients with a high potassium level and should be followed with supervision from a Dietitian. Fruit and vegetables are a very important part of your diet and can actually help to regulate your potassium levels when eaten in the correct amounts, so please continue to include them unless they are in the list to be avoided. You can still aim for 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day from the lower potassium list, and using specific cooking methods as below will also help you enjoy these foods whilst lowering their potassium content .
